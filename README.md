# hse-pix-schedule

Our project for HSExPIXStudio hackaton.

## Overview

In this project we've implemented a telegram bot which gives user an info about his schedule in HSE university.
In order to get schedule, user must log in or sign up if they don't have account. All users info is stored in Excel file.
The robot then reads user's schedule via Google sheets (the links for each groups are also stored in Excel files).
The schedule is available for the whole week or for one day only.
